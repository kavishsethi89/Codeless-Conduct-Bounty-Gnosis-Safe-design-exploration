Codeless Conduct Bounty Gnosis Safe design exploration : Design Submission by Kavish Sethi (discord: kavishsethi#2327)

As a new user/institution, I would like to have easy steps with the highest security possible for my assets.
So I have kept the steps really simple and also changed the design aesthetics.

Design Submission includes three user friendly design pages:-
1. Sign-in with Gnosis - Main Front Page
2. Collective Ownership of NFTs - Collectables Page
3. Emerging Applications Page


Sign-in with Gnosis - Main Page -
It is always a best experience visually for a user to to locate the window easily without too many tabs. 
A simplistic window will open on the first step:
a. New “SAFE” sign-ups
b. Already existing “SAFE”

Collective Ownership of NFTs - Collectables Page - 
Once the NFT is added, one can view and scroll different collectables. It is always fun to visually see your NFT’s and keeps the user interested to keep adding more collectables to the SAFE.

Emerging Applications Page -
It is best to keep just the logos without too much information about each apps on the page. It cleans up the view, and user can easily choose which app to interact with. Placed randomly on the screen and can scroll down for more apps.
